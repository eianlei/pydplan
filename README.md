# PyDplan = Python Dive PLANner

Pydplanner is a Graphical User Interface application for the desktop (Windows, Linux, MAC, etc)
for planning mixed gas staged decompression technical scuba dives. 
Pydplanner can be used for interactive planning of decompression dives using the Bühlmann algorithm.
It is particularily intended for learning and understanding how the Bühlmann algorithm for decompression modeling works.

Pydplan is written in Python 3.6 and the GUI is using PyQt5 library for graphics.

## FillCalc2
FillCalc2.py is an auxiliary tool in this package for interactive gas mixing calculations.

See [FillCalc2 documentations](/doc/fillcalc2.md) for more details about it.

## modCalc2
modCalc2.py is an auxiliary tool in this package for interactive MOD calculation.

See [modCalc2 documentations](/doc/modcalc2.md) for more details about it.

# DISCLAIMER!
This is experimental prototype software under development! Do not use for planning actual dives!

THIS IS A NEW IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BUHLMANN ALGORITHM AND A DIVE PLANNER IMPLEMENTATION BASED ON THAT WHICH HAS RECEIVED ONLY A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TESTING. THE AUTHOR STRONGLY RECOMMENDS NOT TO PLAN DIVES SIMPLY BASED ON THE RESULTS GIVEN BY THIS APPLICATION!

Use this application at your own risk, the author provides no guarantees about the correctness of the application, and assumes no liability for the use of it for any purpose!
* In no event should you consider scuba diving with mixed gases without proper training!
* Ignoring these warnings can cause your **death** or **serious and permanent injuries**!
